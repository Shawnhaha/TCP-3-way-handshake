This program is to simulate TCP 3-way handshake and closing a TCP connection in the application layer
using a client-server architecture.

Put all files to one directory on cse machine.
Type "make" to run makefile.
After makefile runs, the TCP server and client will be compiled.
The executable files called "tserver" and "tclient".
Use ./tserver <Port Number> and ./tclient <Port Number> to run them.
Run the server on cse03.cse.unt.edu machine and the client on cse02.cse.unt.edu machine.
Run the server and client with a same valid port number.
After using the program, you can use "make clean" to remove all executable files.
